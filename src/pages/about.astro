      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight dark:text-white sm:text-4xl mb-2">Beyond Code</h2>
      <p class="text-muted text-lg mt-4">
        When I'm not building data systems, you'll find me on the ultimate frisbee field, strategizing over board games,
        or spending time with my two dogs—a collie and a samoyed. I'm also a dedicated Boston sports fan,
        experiencing all the highs and lows that come with it.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted text-lg mt-4">
        These interests keep me balanced and remind me that the best solutions often come when you step away from the keyboard
        and approach problems with a fresh perspective.
